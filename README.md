4.  I also explore the datas and discovered that all the product together were not sold in any of the region.
But in the western and Eastern region, 4 different products were sold in this regions. The Southern region has proven to have the highest revenue even though they sold only 3 types of products.

## Key Metrics

### Total Sales for each Product Category
1. SELECT SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE product ='Shoes'
2. SELECT SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE product ='Shirt'
3. SELECT SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE product ='Hat'
4. SELECT SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE product ='Jacket'
5. SELECT SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE product ='Gloves'
6. SELECT SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE product ='Socks'

### Number of Sales Transactions in Each Region
SELECT region, COUNT(orderid) as Number_Of_SalesTransaction from CapstoneProjectSalesData GROUP by Region;

### Highest Selling Product By TotalSales Value
SELECT product, SUM(revenue) As TotalSales from CapstoneProjectSalesData GROUP by product ORDER by Total_Sales desc Limit 1

### Total Revenue Per Product
SELECT product, SUM(revenue) As TotalSales from CapstoneProjectSalesData GROUP by product order by TotalSales DESC

### Monthly Sales Totals For the Current Year
SELECT substr(orderdate, 1, 2) as Month, substr(orderdate, 7, 4) as Year, SUM(revenue) as MonthlySales
FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData WHERE year = '024'
GROUP by Month;

### Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase Amount
SELECT customer_id, SUM(revenue) FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData
group by customer_id
order by SUM(revenue) desc limit 5

### Percentage of TotalSales Contributed by Each Region
WITH TotalSales as (SELECT SUM(revenue) as TotalRevenue from CapstoneProjectSalesData)
SELECT region, SUM(revenue) as RegionSales, (SUM(revenue) * 100.0 / TotalSales.TotalRevenue) as Percentagesales
FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData, TotalSales
GROUP by Region;

### Products with no Sales in the last Quarter
SELECT DISTINCT product from CapstoneProjectSalesData 
WHERE orderdate < date('now', '-3 months')
and product not in (SELECT product FROM CapstoneProjectSalesData 
where orderdate >=date('now', '-3 months'));

## Conclusion and Recommendation
The Sales Performance Analysis of the Retail Store reveals valuable insights into Top-selling Products, Regional Performance and Customer behavior towards reodering same product the following months. Below is the SWOT Analysis which will help in taking strategic decisions that will drive growth.
- **Strength:** Hat Sales consistently performed excellently which indicate strong market demand and July also shows to have the highest sales in 2023 and 2024.
- **Weakness:** It was observed that East and West had the highest number of product sold in them, yet the sum of revenue is not quite encouraging
- **Opportunity:** South makes significant sales for the 3 products sold there. If other products were introduced there then there is every likelihood that they will make significant sales like they have done in other products.
- **Threat:** The month of April seems to have consistently made so poor sales which affect the overall total sales. If this continues, it may affect the target for the year.

## Recommendation
1. Socks seems to make low sales, therefore, I recommend Bundle Complementary Products by using Socks to Sell Shoe so that there can be a reasonable improvement in the sales of Shoes in all the overall performance.
2. Optimize inventory management and promotional planning based on onthly sales trends.
3. Monitor and adjust Regional Marketing strategies to address disparities in sales performance

## Implementation Plan
- Assign tasks to relevant teams (Marketing Unit, Sales Unit and Product development)
- Establish timelines for strategy implementation and review
- Track Key Performance Indicators to measure effectiveness.
- Introduce Incentives to performers.
